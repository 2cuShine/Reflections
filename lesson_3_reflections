When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when Iwant to share my repository or even want others to also work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I only want dataflow when I know what's there. Maybe som other persons have added content thatI don't  want to have on my computer.
