When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when Iwant to share my repository or even want others to also work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I only want dataflow when I know what's there. Maybe som other persons have added content thatI don't  want to have on my computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clones are copies of repositories that I can make on my computer or from github to my computer. forks are clones itin github. I can use fork a repository from another github user and work with the fork in my profile. branches are "lines" of commits which can be pushed or pulled t or from github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
When somebody did new commits on Github during me being offline I can fetch those commits and see what was changed by doing git diff. I can also merge the commits.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I wold collaborate by sending changed files to others or uploadiing them to a server and sending others the link and the asking for cheking the files. 
At the moment I don't now wheter t would be easier or harder. Depends on what it is we are woking on, I suppose.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When I make changes that I want others to reflect on and discuss, and when maybe others also make changes to the files, it's goot to make my changes at a different branch. So I can watch the different changes seperately and decide which ones to merge into my master at the end.
