What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A folder named .git is created for a GIT repository. I need it to make commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area only contains the files that should be alltogether saved in a commit. Its value is that I can easily look up which files are saved and which are untracked and I can add files to or remove files from the staging area.
